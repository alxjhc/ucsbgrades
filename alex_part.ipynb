    "Although our raw dataset was relatively tidy, we made sure to manipulate it further in the best possible way for an effective analysis. To do this we thought about our questions in hand and chose to observe a total of 15 quarters starting from Fall 2018 through Spring 2022. The raw dataset had records reaching all the way back to Fall 2009. This way, we would be able to analyze the distribution of grades from before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. We also filtered for courses at the Undergraduate level and excluded the Graduate level. This is what our `grades` dataframe looks like.\n",

    "There are 121385 rows and 6 columns. The columns are as follows: \"Quarter\" corresponds to the quarter and year denoted as the first letter and the last two digits of the year, (i.e. \"F18\"). The second column is \"Course Level2\" which would read as \"Undergraduate\" because we filtered as mentioned before. \"Course\" refers to the course code that each distinct class uses, (i.e. \"PSTAT 100\"). Next, \"Instructor\" is their last name followed by first initial. \"Grade Given\" corresponds to the letter grade distributed on the A+ to F scale, also including \"IP\" (In Progress), \"P\" (Pass), and \"NP\" (No Pass). The last column, \"Sum of Student Count\" refers to how many students received the corresponding letter grade in that given class.\n",

    "This is a figure of 16 line graphs, one for each letter grade on the A+ to F scale, including IP, P, and NP. On the x-axis we have the quarters of interest in order and the y-axis represents the proportion of students that received that grade (out of 1). We observed that the proportion of A+'s and A's jumped significantly between Fall 2019 and Spring 2020, before leveling off the following quarters, a proportion increase of about 0.06 and 0.12 respectively. Conversely, the proportions explained by the letter grades of B through the failing grades saw a trend inverse of that of the former. For example, there were less B's by 0.05 in the similar time frame and 0.03 less C's. We can conclude that professors became more lenient with their grade distributions as a result of the shift in learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",

For this sample, we chose the PSTAT, MATH, ECON, TMP, PSY, and SOC departments as these are very populated majors. As seen, a similar trend is present as expected with the highest mean GPA in Spring 2020 before leveling off and showing a continuing downwards trend towards present day. We see volatility in the quarters right after Spring 2020, and this is explained by professors struggling to adjust standards for grade distributions. The TMP department was an outlier in this case, mean GPA was all over the place and was much lower than the other departments- this is explained by TMP courses curriculum being much more dependent on real life interactions, and was perceived as a secondary field of study, where students would prioritize their main courses first.\n",

On the other hand, the Education department saw a 0.1 decrease in mean during Covid but came back up by 0.3 later on.\n",
